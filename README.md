## About LocX üåç

We all know that there are portals available like Naukri, Shine, and Indeed, where big companies post job openings to seek employees. But what about people with low or no education or those who want part-time jobs locally but cannot find them easily? They need to roam shop to shop to ask whether they want someone or not. With this application, local shops such as medical shops and small offices (referred to as vendors) can post job openings for the type of person or skills they are looking for. On the other side, job seekers can find these jobs and contact the vendors, easily finding a job according to their needs.
